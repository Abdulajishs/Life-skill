# Good Practices for Software Development #

## 1. Which point(s) were new to you? ##
* Use screenshots, diagrams, screencasts tools like loom to show and explain.
* Make sure to ask questions and seek clarity in the meeting itself. Since most of the times, it will be difficult to get the same set of people online again.

## 2. Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area? ##
I need to improve my communication skills. To make progress in this area:

* I'll prioritize using group chats or channels instead of private DMs to keep communication transparent and ensure everyone stays informed.
* I'll avoid missing calls by answering them even if I’m busy and letting the caller know I’ll call back in 5–10 minutes. This is better than leaving calls unanswered.
