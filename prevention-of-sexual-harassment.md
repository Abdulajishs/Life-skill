# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

* **Unwelcome Conduct:** Any verbal, visual, or physical actions that are unwelcome and create discomfort, intimidation, or offense.

* **Inappropriate Comments:** Remarks about someone’s clothing, body, or sexuality, as well as gender-based jokes or foul language that are intended or perceived as sexual in nature.

* **Discussion of Personal Sexual Life:** Conversations or questions about someone’s private sexual life.

* **Unwanted Physical Contact:** Blocking someone’s movement or making physical contact such as kissing, hugging, patting, or stroking without consent.

* **Quid Pro Quo Harassment:** When a supervisor or employer uses job-related rewards or punishments to pressure an employee into a sexual relationship (i.e., “this for that”).


# What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

* **Report the Incident:** I would report the behavior to my supervisor or HR department as soon as possible, as it’s important to document and address the issue immediately. 
* **Directly Report to the Same Person:** If appropriate and safe, I would encourage the person exhibiting the behavior to reflect on their actions and explain why it is inappropriate, fostering accountability.
* **Support the Victim:** If someone else is the victim, I would offer my support, letting them know that they are not alone and encouraging them to report the behavior if they feel safe doing so.
